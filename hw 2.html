  <h1>INDIAN CARROT PUDDING</h1>
  <!--paragraph added-->
  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>Gajar ka halwa, also known as gajorer halua, Gajrela, Gajar Pak, and Carrot halwa is a carrot-based sweet dessert pudding from the Indian subcontinent. 
    It is made by placing grated carrots in a pot containing a specific amount of water, milk and sugar and then cooking while stirring regularly. 
    The dessert is traditionally eaten during all of the festivals in India, mainly on the occasion of Diwali, Holi, Eid al-Fitr and Raksha Bandhan which is why I love it the most as it brings out the unity of the country.
    It is served hot during the winter.</p>
