  <h1>INDIAN CARROT PUDDING</h1>
  
  
  <!--paragraph added-->
  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>Gajar ka halwa, also known as gajorer halua, Gajrela, Gajar Pak, and Carrot halwa is a carrot-based sweet dessert pudding from the Indian subcontinent. 
    It is made by placing grated carrots in a pot containing a specific amount of water, milk and sugar and then cooking while stirring regularly. 
    The dessert is traditionally eaten during all of the festivals in India, mainly on the occasion of Diwali, Holi, Eid al-Fitr and Raksha Bandhan which is why I love it the most as it brings out the unity of the country.
    It is served hot during the winter.</p>

  <p>It is fragrant and rich, but you can eat bowls and bowls of the stuff.
    The way the warm milk coats the tongue, and how the carrots become luscious, giving off a slight taste of earth amidst all the sweetness. 
    There are other types of halwa made with semolina or mung bean but gajar ka halwa is the most iconic</p>

  <h3>Tips to make the best carrot pudding</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Choice of carrots: Always use fresh, tender and young carrots that are less fibrous. If needed taste them before cooking. Carrots that are too old or mature are more fibrous & have a different flavour & texture which do not go well for the halwa. Young carrots are sweeter in flavour and yield a mouth melting carrot halwa. If you cannot find delhi gajar you can use the regular carrots.</li>
    <li>Milk: Use full fat or whole milk to get a tasty carrot halwa. For a low fat version just reduce the amount of milk in the recipe or use low fat milk. You can also skip or reduce the amount of ghee. If you are a vegan you can make this halwa with coconut or almond milk</li>
    <li>Grating carrots: Grate the carrots with a hand held grater or food processor. I always use a food processor. You can grate to thick or thin shreds depending on how you like your carrot halwa to be. My kids like them to be very fine as the halwa just melts off in the mouth. But for this post I have used larger gratings</li>
    <li>Saut√©ing carrots: My mom makes the this by first saut√©ing the grated carrot in ghee for 5 mins. Then pouring the milk. However I do not do this just to save time. Adding ghee at a later time, once the halwa is cooked gives a more intense flavour. So you can do either ways</li>
    <li>Cooking: Be cautious & do not leave the carrot halwa on the stove unattended as the milk will get scorched and burnt. You will need to constantly stir the gajar halwa</li>
  </ol>
